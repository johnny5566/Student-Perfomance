# Student-Perfomance
Project Description: Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes student performance using statistical techniques and machine learning. The dataset contains student demographic information and exam scores in math, reading, and writing. The goal is to identify key factors influencing student performance and build a predictive model.

Project Workflow:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and dataset visualization.

Score distribution analysis using histograms.

Statistical Analysis

ANOVA tests to determine the impact of categorical variables (e.g., gender, parental education) on performance.

Correlation matrix to examine relationships between math, reading, and writing scores.

Feature Engineering

One-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Standardization of numerical features for better model performance.

Model Building & Evaluation

Linear Regression model to predict math scores based on other features.

Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

Key Findings:
Parental education, gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type, and test preparation courses significantly affect student performance.

Higher parental education and standard lunch correlate with better scores.

Test preparation courses improve exam results significantly.
